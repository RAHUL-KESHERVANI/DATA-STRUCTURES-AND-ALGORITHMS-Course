Problem 1) [2 marks]
Write a program to compute x^y, where x and y are ints. The computation should be based on using base-3 presentation of a number. 

This problem is exactly same as the one solved in the class. The code given in this file, as solved in class,  pow2.c  http://moodle.coep.org.in/moodle/pluginfile.php/29815/mod_folder/content/0/pow2.c?forcedownload=1 uses the concept of base-2 representation of a number. You have to derive the logic using base-3 presentation of a number. This will be applied to y. 

In the program, write a function which computs x^y like this:  double pow(int x, int y);

The program will read x and y from the user using scanf(). 

Hint: Instead of squaring the term, you will cube the term now. 

Filename:   xpow3y.c 

Problem 2) [2  marks]
Write a program to remove duplicate doubles from an array of doubles, without changing the ordering of the numbers. The program reads the data from a binary file containing double numbers.

In the program, write a function which accepts an array of doubles and removes the duplicates from the array and has returns the no. of doubles remaining.  The function prototype is given below:

int removeduplicate(double a[], int n); 
Here, n is the number of doubles in the array a[]. 

Note that removing a double here means, the array will have <=n elements after the function. This means shifting/moving of existing elements and readjusting the value of 'n'. This new value of n will be returned. 

Filename:  remdup.c

Problem 3) [3 marks]
Write a complete C program, which has following function:

int stringreplace(char *text, char *orig, char *new);

This function replaces all occurrences  of the string orig inside the string text to the string new and then returns the number of instances replaced. Note: the string text changes as a result of the program.

filename: stringreplace.c

Examples
1)

text:  thisismynamewhatishisname
orig:    his

new:   her
After function call, text becomes: therismynamewhatishername and function returns 2 as it did 2 replacements.

2)
text:  aabrakaadaabraaisgaabra

orig:   abr
new:  bing

after function call text becomes: abingakaadabingaaisgabinga and function returns 3 as it did three replacements.
Use the following main function:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char text[128], orig[128], new[128]; // don't assume size of 128 in the function stringreplace, it is not available in the function!
    int count;
    while(scanf("%s%s%s", text, orig, new) != -1) {
       count = stringreplace(text, orig, new);
       printf("%d %s\n", count, text);
    }
}
